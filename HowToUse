Here is a quick guide on how to use this Chess computer/playing field application:


1). Click the start button in the IDE.

2). In the terminal, the program will ask for the engine depth(difficulty) to be specified. Note that a half move is a singular move of black or white.
    So 4 half moves is 2 full moves of black or white. Please use only values between 1 and 4, as 0 is an undefined depth and more than 4 will take too long.
    * I recommend three for a fairly quick playing experience and pretty good ai

3). The program will ask for moves to be input. Input moves in the following manner:
    - Use the letters and numbers on the edges to find the square on the grid where the piece you want to move is located.
    - Do the same for the square where you want the piece in the previous square you found to move to.
    - Write the letter then number of the first square, space, then second.
    - Example: e2 e4, this moves the piece in e2 square to the e4 square, if it is a legal move.

    Special Cases:
    - Program says, "Not a Legal Move". In this case it means that the move you entered is not a legal one.
    - Castling: Input the square of the King, then the square where the king will end up after castling. For white the two castling options are, e1 g1 and e1 c1.

4). The program will print the new chess board with your move being made.

5). After a wait of 0-(2-4) seconds based off of the depth you preciously selected, the program will output a red line followed by the new board with the engine's move on it.

6). One full move has been completed. If the game has ended, in a win/loss or a tie(Tie by repetition is not currently supported) it will print out, and you should stop playing.

7). Keep making moves and playing chess!
